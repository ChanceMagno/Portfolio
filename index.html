              My name is Chance, I am currently a student at a programming school called <strong>Epicodus</strong> in Portland, Oregon. I have lived in the Northwest all my life but have been fortunate enough to have travelled to many places over the world. I decided to pursue becoming a programmer when I discovered how much I enjoyed working on challenging projects. With my previous job leaving me wanting more I began exploring and quickly found myself drawn to programming. I knew once I was staying up late figuring out programming problems by choice, it was time for me to commit myself.
