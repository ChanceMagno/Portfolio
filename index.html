                <span style="color:black">My name is Chance,</span> I am currently a student at a programming school called <strong>Epicodus</strong> in <em>Portland, Oregon.</em> I have lived in the Northwest all my life but have been fortunate enough to have travelled to many places over the world. I decided to pursue becoming a programmer when I discovered how much I enjoyed working on challenging projects. With my previous job leaving me wanting more, I began exploring and quickly found myself drawn to programming. <blockquote>"I knew programming was what I wanted to do when I found myself staying up late having fun playing with code."</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>I didn't waste time, I sold my personal race car to fund this carreer change, applied at Epicodus and turned in my resignation letter.

              <span style="color:black">My background</span> began in the automotive world. I started while completing highschool as a car electronics installer. I learned while in school how to install various electronics into vehicles.<br>
              I then was fortunate enough to get a entry level job as a automotive technician. This job was great as they would not only train me on the job but also pay for classses to help me progress.<br>
              After 5 years learning and reparing vehicles, I decided to stay in the auto industry just move to a "cleaner" envirement. I got a job processing vehicles into the country. After 2 years I was promoted to supervisor. Unfortunetly I found myself bored and left with little challenge which led me to where I am now.<br>
              I am currently a student at Epicodus where I hope to jumpstart my career in programming.

              <span style="color:black">Interest and hobbies</span> aside from programming are all over the place. I enjoy spending time with my family, traveling, working/building/racing cars, gaming and building computers.<br>
              My main hobby would have to be in short, cars. I put together my own race car from practically the ground up that I take for cruises, races and car shows. My work stood out and I ended up being noticed in the car community, which led to me taking on huge projects that required extensive planning and building along with its fair share of troubleshooting....sounds a lot like programming.
