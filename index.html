              My name is Chance, I am currently a student at a programming school called <strong>Epicodus</strong> in Portland, Oregon. I have lived in the Northwest all my life but have been fortunate enough to have travelled to many places over the world. I decided to pursue becoming a programmer when I discovered how much I enjoyed working on challenging projects. With my previous job leaving me wanting more, I began exploring and quickly found myself drawn to programming. <blockquote>"I knew programming was what I wanted to do when I found myself staying up late having fun playing with code."</blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>I didn't waste time, I sold my personal race car to fund this carreer change, applied at Epicodus and turned in my resignation letter.
